       <h2> Reasons why This is Believed </h2>

       <h4> 
         1. The forefront of the theory is this: advanced civilizations could run computer simulations that simulate concious beings; current trends in technology such as AI and virtual reality suggest that, at one point, humanity may be able to simulate a virtual world. If this is possible, it is more likely that advanced civilizations have done the same.
         <br>
         <br>
         2. Another aspect of the theory is that our universe could be simulated by a technologically advanced human civilization that wants to find a way out of some sort of energy crisis, hence climate change.
         <br>
         <br>
         3. The universe behaves very mathematically, and is broken down to subatomic particles, resembling a pixelated video game.
         <br>
         <br>
         4. Findings in quantum physics shed doubt on the fact that the material universe is real.
         <br>
         <br>
         5. The advanced beings that would be simulating humanity could have acsess to unlimited computing power.

  <h2> Reasons Why People Disagree </h2>
  <br>
  <h4> 1. A higher species might not want to simulate humanity.  
  <br>
  <br>
  2. Theoretically, to build a computer with enough power would require more atoms than there are in the universe.
    <br>
    <br>
    3. Our world is very complex, possibly complex enough for computers to be unable to simulate it.
